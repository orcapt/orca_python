Australian police are treating as a "terrorist incident" a Melbourne siege in which a gunman was killed.
Heavily armed officers arrived at an apartment building on Monday after reports of an explosion and found one man already dead in the foyer.
Another man, Yacqub Khayre, was holding a woman inside the building against her will.
Khayre, 29, called a broadcaster during the siege to say he was acting in the name of the Islamic State (IS) group.
A news outlet for the group claimed it had carried out the attack, but police said there was no evidence of it co-ordinating with Khayre.
Three police officers suffered injuries after Khayre engaged them in a firefight in which he was shot dead. The hostage was rescued unharmed.The latest developments since three Gulf Arab states cut ties with Qatar on Monday morning:

6:30am - Dialogue is the way to solve disputes, Qatar's foreign minister says

"For us, the strategic choice of the state of Qatar is to solve any dispute through dialogue," Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani tells Al Jazeera.

"We are going through extremely difficult circumstances and challenges and there are wars in the Arab world and people killed whether due to terrorism and extremism or terror crimes committed by regimes against their peoples. And there is a crisis in Yemen, Syria and Libya, and these challenges must unite us. We are surprised that at such a time, a GCC country is being attacked by other GCC countries."

1:30am Tuesday - Qatari foreign minister discusses crisis with Al Jazeera

Qatar's Foreign Minister Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani tells Al Jazeera in an interview he is unsure why the situation escalated the way it did.

He said the emir of Kuwait was traveling to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to assist in "containing the crisis". Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani will give a speech to the nation on Tuesday to address the situation.

He added there's a big question mark over the future of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

"Regarding the reasons for this escalation, honestly, we don't know if there were real reasons for this crisis or whether it was based on things we're unaware of. If there were real reasons, it would have been put on the table for discussion during the GCC meeting, but none of that was mentioned. It wasn't mentioned either during the American-Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh. There were no indications whatsoever," the foreign minister said.

"There was an unprecedented escalation from the mass media of these countries insulting a brotherly nation, using the type of language that was never used before against the leadership. Qatar has not met this escalation with escalation. We've been trying to deal with this wisely. We haven't responded to them on the same level."
